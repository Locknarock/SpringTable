# SpringTable
Spring table for my portfolio

This is my spring table to use with my portfolio website https://gytis-portfolio.netlify.app/

Was made using extensions and vs Code.

To run it you need mySQL and create SCHEMA there named my_spring_db.
Schema has 1 table named users with colums [nr,name,sur_name,email,age]

If you leave the table empty dummy data will be created.

In order for this to work start this project on port 8080

And edit the application.properties accordingly.
